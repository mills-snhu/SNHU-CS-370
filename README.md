<h3>Trends in Computer Science (AI)</h3>
<hr> 
<p><b>Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:</b>
  This project was focused on learning and producing code for reinforcement learning to train artificial intelligence. Assignements included adjusting hyperparameters to compare the output results.
  For the final assignment I was given Python code in .py files that were imported to a Jupyter Notebook and Keras was used for deep learning.
  The main loop of the deep learning training is code that I wrote to iterate through training an agent to solve a simple 2-dimentional grid environment game with the Epsilon-Greedy method</p><br>
<p><b>Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:</b> 
  The focus of artificial intelligence in this class provided me with a beginning knowledge on machine learning and its inplications in the computer science industry. This was an accumulation of skills learned in other classes working with programming languages, programs such as Jupyter Notebook, ethics in Computer Science, and problem-solving. </p><br>
<p><b>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?</b>
  Computer Scientists expand the technologies in softwore to new possibilities through exploration, experimentation, analysis, and collaboration.</p><br>
<p><b>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?</b>
  Defining the problem is the first step to approaching a problem, this allows me to have a focus point. Next is to identify other components that could affect or be affected by the current problem. Testing often is crutial to solving a problem as to not change alot of code before testing, this helps pinpoint the problem area.</p><br>
<p><b>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?</b>
  Data protection and Transparency </p><br>
